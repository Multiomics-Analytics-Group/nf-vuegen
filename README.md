## About the project
The VueGen [nf-core][nfcore] module is designed to automate report generation from outputs produced by other modules, subworkflows, or pipelines. The module integrates the [VueGen Python library][vuegen] and customizes it for compatibility with the [Nextflow][nextflow] environment. VueGen automates the creation of reports from bioinformatics outputs, supporting formats like PDF, HTML, DOCX, ODT, PPTX, Reveal.js, Jupyter notebooks, and Streamlit web applications. Users simply provide a directory with output files and VueGen compiles them into a structured report.

This module is compatible with existing Nextflow reporting tools such as [MultiQC][multiqc], [AssemblyQC][assemblyqc], and others, allowing their HTML outputs to be embedded as components within VueGen reports. 

An overview of the VueGen workflow is shown in the figure below:

A metro-map representation of the VueGen nf-core module is presented below:

The workflow starts with an input dataset and continues through different stages, generating intermediate outputs in various formats. In the final stage, the VueGen nf-core module collects these outputs from a folder and generates reports in multiple formats.

The VueGen documentation is available at [vuegen.readthedocs.io][vuegen-docs], where you can find detailed information of the packageâ€™s classes and functions, installation and execution instructions, and case studies to demonstrate its functionality.

## Web application deployment
Once a Streamlit report is generated, it can be deployed as a web application to make it accessible online. There are multiple ways to achieve this:

* **Streamlit Community Cloud**: Deploy your report easily using [Streamlit Cloud][st-cloud], as demonstrated in the [EMP VueGen Demo][emp-st-demo]. The process involves moving the necessary scripts, data, and a requirements.txt file into a GitHub repository. Then, the app can be deployed via the Streamlit Cloud interface. The deployment example is available in the `streamlit-report-example` branch.
* **Standalone Executables**: Convert your Streamlit application into a desktop app by packaging it as an executable file for different operating systems. A detailed explanation of this process can be found in this [Streamlit forum post][st-forum-exe].
* **Stlite**: Run Streamlit apps directly in the browser with [stlite][stlite], a WebAssembly port of Streamlit powered by Pyodide, eliminating the need for a server. It also allows packaging apps as standalone desktop executables using stlite desktop.

These options provide flexibility depending on whether the goal is online accessibility, lightweight execution, or local application distribution.
